This is project 1 in the Self-driving Car Nanodegree from Udacity, lead by Sebastian Thrun.

In this project I was tasked with finding the lane lines by building an image-processing pipeline using OpenCV. 
To see the result of the project one can ether run the jupyter notebook with the environment.yml or check out the videos in this repository /test_videos_output.
